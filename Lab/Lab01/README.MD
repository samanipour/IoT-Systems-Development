## Getting Started with Arduino IDE for Programming ESP8266 (Wemos D1 R1)

This guide will help you set up the Arduino IDE to program your Wemos D1 R1 (ESP8266-based) board and write code to blink the onboard LED.

### **Step 1: Install the Arduino IDE**
If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed yet:
1. Download it from [Arduino’s official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### **Step 2: Install the ESP8266 Board Support**
To program your ESP8266 board (Wemos D1 R1) with the Arduino IDE, you need to install the necessary board support.

1. **Open the Arduino IDE**.
2. **Go to File → Preferences**.
3. In the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, add the following URL:
   ```
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
   If you already have other URLs listed, separate them with commas.
4. Click **OK** to save and close the Preferences window.
5. **Go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager**.
6. Type `esp8266` in the search bar.
7. Find **esp8266 by ESP8266 Community** and click **Install**.
8. Wait for the installation to finish. After that, your ESP8266 boards will be available in the Arduino IDE.

### **Step 3: Select the Correct Board and Port**

1. **Go to Tools → Board**, and from the list, select your board:
   - **Wemos D1 R1** or **NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)** (they use the same ESP8266 chip).
   
2. **Go to Tools → Port**, and select the COM port associated with your Wemos D1 R1 board.
   - If you're unsure about the port, disconnect and reconnect the USB cable, and check the new port that appears.

### **Step 4: Circuit Setup**

While the Wemos D1 R1 board has an onboard LED (connected to GPIO2), let’s first focus on that, but I’ll also explain how you can add external components for other projects in the future.

#### **Onboard LED (No External Circuit Required)**
- **The Wemos D1 R1 comes with a built-in LED** on GPIO2 (also labeled as D4 on the board). This LED can be controlled directly from the code.

#### **Optional: External LED Setup (If You Want to Use an External LED)**
To blink an external LED, you can set up the following simple circuit:

1. **Components:**
   - 1 x LED (any color)
   - 1 x 220Ω Resistor
   - Breadboard and jumper wires

2. **Circuit Connections:**
   - **Anode (longer leg) of the LED** goes to a GPIO pin (for example, **D5**, which corresponds to GPIO14).
   - **Cathode (shorter leg)** of the LED goes to one side of a **220Ω resistor**.
   - The other side of the resistor goes to the **GND** (ground) pin on the Wemos D1 R1.

   **Diagram:**
   ```
   Wemos D1 R1 GPIO14 (D5) → LED → Resistor → GND
   ```

### **Step 5: Write the Code to Blink the Onboard LED**

Now, let’s write a simple sketch to blink the onboard LED (GPIO2).

1. Open a new sketch in the Arduino IDE (File → New).
2. Copy and paste the following code:

   ```cpp
   // Pin for the onboard LED on Wemos D1 R1 (GPIO2)
   const int ledPin = 2; // GPIO2 (D4) is the onboard LED pin

   void setup() {
     // Initialize the LED pin as an output
     pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
   }

   void loop() {
     // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
     digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
     // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
     delay(1000);
     // Turn the LED off (LOW is the voltage level)
     digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
     // Wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
     delay(1000);
   }
   ```

3. **Explanation of the Code:**
   - `ledPin = 2`: The onboard LED is connected to GPIO2 (which corresponds to D4 on the Wemos D1 R1).
   - `pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT)`: Sets the pin mode to output so you can control the LED.
   - `digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH)` and `digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW)`: Turns the LED on and off.
   - `delay(1000)`: Pauses the execution for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) between turning the LED on and off.

### **Step 6: Upload the Code to the Wemos D1 R1**

1. **Connect your Wemos D1 R1** to your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Click the Upload button** (the right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your ESP8266.
3. Wait for the upload to complete. Once the upload is done, the message **"Done uploading"** will appear in the IDE.

---

### **Step 7: Monitor the Output**

Once the code is uploaded:
- The onboard LED (GPIO2/D4) on your Wemos D1 R1 should start blinking **once every second**.
- If you used an external LED setup as well, the external LED should blink according to the code.

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **If the LED doesn’t blink:**
  - Double-check the wiring and ensure that the correct GPIO pin is used in your code.
  - Make sure the correct board (Wemos D1 R1) and port are selected in the **Tools** menu.
  
- **If the upload fails:**
  - Press and hold the **"FLASH" button** on the Wemos D1 R1 during the upload process. Some ESP8266 boards need to be in "flash mode" to upload code properly.
  
- **If you don’t see the correct COM port:**
  - Ensure the USB-to-serial drivers are correctly installed for the ESP8266 chip. For Windows, you may need to install the **CP2102 USB-to-UART driver**.

### Conclusion:
You’ve successfully set up the Arduino IDE to program your ESP8266-based Wemos D1 R1 board. The onboard LED should now be blinking every second, and you’re ready to explore more complex projects with the ESP8266!
